# Scala Course 

## Objectives

There are many Scala Courses available. Some are free, most of them are fairly affordable, and a few are quite expensive. An average developer can reach out for such existing resources choosing varied approaches in search of a most competitive position. Financial rewards are certainly attractive in the booming Scala FP market.

Why are experienced Scala developers so scarce? And why they are in demand?

One possible explanation is that we are in the middle of a transition. The OOP generation is giving place to a new FP one. The educational infrastructure did not catch up, and the gap is being filled by a few private initiatives. Our objective is to compete in this flourishing scenario.

## Strategy

How do we differentiate?

* Liase to clients already aware of the advantages of an experienced FP team,
* Understand their specific needs, and
* Upskill OOP seasoned developers to meet client expectations as an outsourced team.

## Challenges

* Appropriate screening and selection of candidates,
* Continuos assessment along the learning curve,
* Alignement to client objectives, specially if a course is targeted to more than one client,
* Delivery warrant in the first six months.

## Pre-requisites

Candidates must comply with a minumum experience and have developed a basic set of skills in order to allow the course to achieve its goals in limited time.

The client (or clients) should agree on materials that are specific to their needs, as the number of technical choices is large.

After candidate selection and client agreements, the course is developed in 3 phases.
