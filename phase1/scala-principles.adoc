= Scala Principles

* Expressions are composable, so everything in Scala is an expression.
* Pattern matching is the dual of composition.
* Everything can be grouped and nested, resulting in conciseness (or confusion).
* Functions are abstracted expressions.
* Uniform set of operations to transform data.
