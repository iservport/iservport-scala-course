= Coming from other languages

General advice:

* Keep it simple, as there is a confusing number of possibilities.
* look for construction blocks available that you already know;
 ** e.g. a loop can be converted using combinators like map and filter,
 ** or you can write a recursive function.
* move statements into expressions.
* Move mutable state into immutable and get used to the abstractions used for concurrency;
 ** e.g. Scala Futures are different to Java Futures as the latter are blocking.
* Get familiar with SBT.
* Choose your tooling (Intellij, VSCode, Emacs, etc)
* Tips for speedy compilation (1k vs 10k local/s):
 ** The more types you annotate the better, because type inference is costly.
 ** Fewer implicits sves the compiler resoltion,
function values -> inner -> top level; moving to J8, which has lambdas.
